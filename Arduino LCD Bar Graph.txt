Sure, here's a basic example of Arduino code that demonstrates how to create a simple bar graph on a 16x2 LCD:

```cpp
#include <LiquidCrystal.h>

LiquidCrystal lcd(12, 11, 5, 4, 3, 2);  // Adjust pin numbers based on your wiring

void setup() {
  lcd.begin(16, 2);  // Initialize the LCD with 16 columns and 2 rows
  lcd.clear();
}

void loop() {
  int dataValue = analogRead(A0);  // Replace with your actual data source
  int barLength = map(dataValue, 0, 1023, 0, 16);  // Map data range to LCD columns

  lcd.clear();
  lcd.setCursor(0, 0);
  lcd.print("Bar Graph Example");

  lcd.setCursor(0, 1);
  for (int i = 0; i < barLength; i++) {
    lcd.write(255);  // Display custom character or use '=' for a simple bar
  }
  delay(500);  // Delay to control the update rate
}
```

Note that this example uses the "LiquidCrystal" library and assumes you have the LCD connected to the specified pins. You'll need to replace `A0` with the actual pin or data source you're using. The code reads the analog value from the source and maps it to the number of characters to display as a bar on the LCD. Custom characters can be created for better bar representation.

Remember that this is a basic starting point, and you can customize the code according to your requirements, such as adding labels, adjusting the mapping, or enhancing the graphical representation.
