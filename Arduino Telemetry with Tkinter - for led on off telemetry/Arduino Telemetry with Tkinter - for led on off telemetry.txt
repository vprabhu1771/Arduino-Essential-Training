Certainly! Controlling an LED and displaying its on/off state through telemetry can be a straightforward project. Here's how you can create a Python Tkinter application to control an LED and display its state:

**Hardware Setup:**

1. Connect an LED to a digital pin on the Arduino (e.g., pin 9). Use a current-limiting resistor in series with the LED.

**Software Development:**

1. **Arduino Code:**

Here's a simple Arduino code that receives commands to turn the LED on and off and sends its current state as telemetry:

```cpp
const int ledPin = 9;
bool ledState = false;

void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  if (Serial.available() > 0) {
    char command = Serial.read();
    if (command == '1') {
      ledState = true;
      digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
    } else if (command == '0') {
      ledState = false;
      digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
    }
  }
  Serial.print(ledState);
  delay(1000);  // Update every 1 second
}
```

2. **Python Code with Tkinter:**

Here's a Python script using Tkinter to create a GUI that allows you to control the LED's state and displays its current state:

```python
import serial
import tkinter as tk

ser = serial.Serial('COM3', 9600)  # Adjust port and baud rate

def set_led(state):
    command = '1' if state else '0'
    ser.write(command.encode())

def update_telemetry():
    ser.write(b"REQ")
    led_state = int(ser.readline().decode().strip())

    state_label.config(text=f"LED State: {'On' if led_state else 'Off'}")
    root.after(1000, update_telemetry)

def toggle_led():
    current_state = int(ser.readline().decode().strip())
    set_led(not current_state)

root = tk.Tk()
root.title("LED Control")

state_label = tk.Label(root, text="LED State: N/A")
state_label.pack()

toggle_button = tk.Button(root, text="Toggle LED", command=toggle_led)
toggle_button.pack()

update_telemetry()
root.mainloop()
```

In this example, the GUI allows you to toggle the LED on and off and displays its current state based on the telemetry received from the Arduino.

Make sure to adjust the serial port and other parameters to match your setup. This is a basic example, and you can further enhance it with error handling and additional features as needed.
